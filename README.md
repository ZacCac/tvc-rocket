# Rocket 0-01

0-01 is a model rocket that will utilize thrust vector control to correct its direction throughout its flight.

## What is thrust vector control?

**Thrust vector control**, or *TVC*, is the ability to alter the angular velocity of the vehicle. This will be achieved by using a gimbal to rotate the entire motor of the rocket.

## Workflow

Since there are many aspects of this project, they are each seperated into respective categories:
* **Code** includes all the code for the flight software, launch pad (in development), and simulations.
* **CAD** includes all the .step files for all 3D models on the rocket. 3D printed parts are denoted by **INCORPORATE LATER**
* **Photos** will contain all the photos of the development process, as well as videos when Rocket 0-01 is in testing.
